We present \texttt{termal}, a fast, interactive, terminal-based viewer for
    multiple sequence alignments (MSAs), designed for use on remote systems such
    as high-performance computing (HPC) clusters. Unlike traditional graphical
    viewers, \texttt{termal} runs entirely within a terminal, but like graphical
    viewers, it offers features such as scrolling, zooming,
    consensus/conservation visualization, and colour schemes.
