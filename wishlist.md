# Wishlist

potential enhancements and new features that would make termal faster, clearer, or more useful

- [x] SVG export of the current view (alignment pane + labels + consensus), with configurable scale and color theme.
- [ ] Sequence annotation tracks (domains, motifs, low complexity) shown as a dedicated panel or overlay.
- [ ] FASTA header metadata parsing with configurable field display and sorting. (example: color by species, transcript #, flags)
- [x] Multiple view presets (wide/tall, dense/sparse, minimal) toggled by hotkeys. (covered by zoom functionality)
- [ ] External tool integration for BLAST/HHsearch on selected sequences.
- [ ] Alignment statistics summary panel (gap %, identity %, entropy, composition).
- [ ] Import/export of selected sequences or visible subset to FASTA/Stockholm/clustal, add support for more formats and auto-detection.
- [x] Session files to restore filters, searches, ordering, and panes.
- [x] Realigning using mafft or clustal (shown in .termalconfig) and ordering by phylogenetic tree. 
- [x] Toggleable panel to show tree with simple graphics.
- [ ] Selection and navigation by phylogenetic tree (jump between clades/leaf nodes).
- [ ] Multi-level undo/redo for reject/filter actions and search edits.
- [x] Notes pane to record information about session
