potential enhancements and new features that would make termal faster, clearer, or more useful

1) SVG export of the current view (alignment pane + labels + consensus), with configurable scale and color theme.
2) Sequence annotation tracks (domains, motifs, low complexity) shown as a dedicated panel or overlay.
5) FASTA header metadata parsing with configurable field display and sorting.  (example: color by species, transcript #, flags)
6) Multiple view presets (wide/tall, dense/sparse, minimal) toggled by hotkeys.  (already present in zoom functionality)
8) External tool integration for BLAST/HHsearch on selected sequences.
9) Alignment statistics summary panel (gap %, identity %, entropy, composition).
10) Import/export of selected sequences or visible subset to FASTA/Stockholm/clustal, add support for more formats and auto-detection.
12) Session files to restore filters, searches, ordering, and panes.
13) re-aligning using mafft or clustal (shown in tools.config) and ordering by phylogenetic tree. Toggleable panel to show tree with simple graphics.
