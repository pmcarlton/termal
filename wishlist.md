This list captures potential enhancements and new features that would make termal
faster, clearer, and more useful to bioinformaticians and biologists.

1) SVG export of the current view (alignment pane + labels + consensus), with
   configurable scale and color theme.
2) Sequence annotation tracks (domains, motifs, low complexity) shown as a
   dedicated panel or overlay.
3) Consensus logo and per-column information content plots (sequence logo view).
4) Interactive column and row filters (by regex, length, gap fraction, metadata).
5) FASTA header metadata parsing with configurable field display and sorting.
6) Multiple view presets (wide/tall, dense/sparse, minimal) toggled by hotkeys.
7) Search bookmarks with labels, colors, and navigation across matches.
8) External tool integration for BLAST/HHsearch on selected sequences.
9) Alignment statistics summary panel (gap %, identity %, entropy, composition).
10) Quick export of selected sequences or visible subset to FASTA/Stockholm.
11) Phylip and A3M input support with auto-detection.
12) Session files to restore filters, searches, ordering, and panes.
